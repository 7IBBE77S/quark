## Document the project
"...in as much detail as you can for me, your project manager. The purpose of this document is to convince me that our company should support your work."

We have plans to develop a Go application development environment and a game terrain generation application.Simultaneous development will provide an amount of synergy: the dev app will need a separate program or project to work with and the terrain generator could use the help of an integrated development environment (IDE).

The procedural terrain generator would be later be used to develop a virtual world for a game. Long term plans for the game involve the test and development of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology until mature enough to deploy apart from the game.

## Describe the problem
"GoLand by JetBrains provides an ergonomic environment for Go development, extending the IntelliJ platform with coding assistance and tool integrations." However, developers may appreciate a tool that streamlines the fundamentals of program development like the Electron environment.

As human wealth increases (individually and/or collectively), we find that we have more free time on our hands. A popular and mentally stimulating activity, especially by the youth, is video gaming. Next generation games are always in demand. Next generation games do not come directly from established studios, who are invested in to the point of no longer being able to "do anything different". They stick with "what works" and refine the graphics, gameplay, etc.

New gaming dynamics and experiences often come from upstart, new sources. Gamers will always need fresh innovation. The basic formula being used here is start with something familiar (a virtual world, with procedurally generated terrain) and try (and add) something different. Perlin noise will be mathematically (procedurally) generated to simulate "natural looking" variation in earthly terrain, over which would be laid blob style color groups representing different types of terrain and climates. Jungle may be the featured terrain getting more focused development later, but transition to related terrain is planned.

The gaming side of this project promises new blood and would eventually begin in a jungle landscape (a not to often done scene). It should be more of a simulation across a variety of small planets (planetoids), a multiplayer tribe city/empire development sim, with other popular gameplay elements such as exploration, resource gathering, crafting, industry, and some magic, including portals to other worlds/planetoids. Different sized and multiple planets provide a way to tune and balance the gameplay between players and land.

Looking a little further into the future, the in-game economy shall be used to test and develop new cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. Players and NPC AI will use the tech until it's mature enough to release into "real life". At which point, the game and its player base first adopters will provide established publicity and representation in the market.

## Explain the target audience
Devs using Go for the IDE. 
If shared, game developers may appreciate another, potentially unique example of game terrain generator. Later, gamers may appreciate a new kind of game (using the terrain generator).

## Device requirements
Desktop computer, OS TBD

## System requirements
It's currently being developed on iOS and Windows 10. Ultimately, all products from the project should be compatible with both.
